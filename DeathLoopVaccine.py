#
# simple utility to prevent Everquest Death Loop
#
# The utility functions by parsing the current (most recent) Everquest log file, and if it detects
# Death Loop symptoms, it will respond by initiating a system process kill of all "eqgame.exe"
# processes (there should usually only be one).
#
# We will define a death loop as any time a player experiences X deaths in Y seconds, and no player
# activity during that time.  The values for X and Y are configurable, via the myconfig.py file.
#
# For testing purposes, there is a back door feature, controlled by sending a tell to the following
# non-existent player:
#
#   death_loop:     Simulates a player death.
#
#                   Note however that this also sets a flag that disarms the conceptual
#                   "process-killer gun", which will allow every bit of the code to
#                   execute and be tested, but will stop short of actually killing any
#                   process
#
#                   The "process-killer gun" will then be armed again after the simulated
#                   player deaths trigger the simulated process kill, or after any simulated
#                   player death events "scroll off" the death loop monitoring window.
